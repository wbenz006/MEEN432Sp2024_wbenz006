PROJECT 4 READ ME
WEEK 1: Attempt at combining lateral and longitudinal dynamics. Since velocity in the X direction is found via the previous Project 3 it was attached to the model from Project 2 from the lateral dynamics. Unfortunately there are errors within the model and scripts that I am unable to find out. The variables for X and Y are not being noticed even though I have them set to workspaces and the settings of which have them set to be logged. Initially I thought it may be auto done for logsout configuration but my main.m script does not utilize that function.

HOW TO RUN: Download all files from the Project 4 folder in the repository(variables changed in scripts so these files must be used) and ensure they are all in the same folder. Run the P4init.m and then the main.m file to run with the model.

ERRORS: I have added pictures of some of the errors. Since I don’t have the battery set up yet it should just be using the given velocity of 15 m/s in the init file. Still, the XY graph can’t seem to follow the path desired. In the 2nd driver model that goes to the lateral dynamics there might be a sync error causing the effect to go haywire. Any advice would be great.
